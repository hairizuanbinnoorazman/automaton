# Automaton Spec

This is a set of specs for the automaton CLI toolkit

The specs are further described in their respective subfolders

## Audit

The audit is part of the specs to be able to audit the usage of the different marketing tools out there.  
The main tool we would target would be Google Analytics - this is the most widely used tool out there right now.  

It would be ideal for the audit tool to do the following:
- Generate an automated set of configs to use
- Run an audit based on a config
- Run a single audit for testing out the capability

## Guide

## Apply

The apply functionality is the more complex set of tooling available in automaton.  
Ideally, the functionality should be able to allow you to set the initial recommended settings.   
However, it should also be able to generate a config file based on the same type of audit result.  

- Generate config
- Apply a single config onto the marketing tool
